This dissertation presents the development of a web application for network analysis and mapping.
The application provides functionalities for uploading network data, visualizing network maps, and re-
trieving performance parameters for the network nodes. Through the implementation of various con-
troller functions, data models, and routing mechanisms, the integration of these technologies has been
demonstrated to create a robust and efficient system. MongoDB was utilized as the database manage-
ment system to offer scalability and flexibility in handling the network data. The visualization capabilities
provided by the application enable users to analyze network maps and retrieve performance parame-
ters for network elements seamlessly. This dissertation was made in collaboration with Infinera, who
produced the optical networksâ€™ data to then allow its graphical representation with the aim of easing the
study of different optical networks.
